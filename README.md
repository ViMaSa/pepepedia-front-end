# Approach
- Display a form to create a new Pepe meme entry.
- Display pepe meme including important information
- Have Form underneath each meme to have updating available. NOTE: Each form requires each field to be added even for updates


# Unsolved Problems
- Would like to have each field be updated or if only one field is different, change only that field and leave the rest. 
- Make previous entry data appear in edit form
- Obviously make the front-end look nicer and set height and width of images instead of varying size
